# St.Paul-Budget-Data-Visualization
This project was created for CSCI5609: Visualization at the University of Minnesota- Twin Cities as an introduction to the Processing language.  It visualizes St. Paul, MN's budget data through bar charts and glyphs.


Note: In the data folder located inside of both the glyphChart and barChart folders, the csv file containing the data must be unzipped.
